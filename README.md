These are the source codes for "Morphological Augmentation of Image Data using Three-Dimensional Discrete Fuzzy Numbers: A Theoretical Foundation".
The datasets are pre-processed as MAT files for accelerating training. The MAT file of STL10 is provided and its share link is contained in pre-processed datasets.txt.
gdfn-illustration.mlx is used to morphologically transform single image in Matlab.
gdfn.py is the method of morphological transform used in model training.
