Paper Title "Morphological Augmentation of Image Data using Three-Dimensional Discrete Fuzzy Numbers: A Theoretical Foundation".  

All the involved datasets are public and can be obtained according to the referred papers. In our method, the datasets are pre-processed as MAT files for accelerating training. A sample of the pre-processed dataset files is provided in "pre-processed dataset.txt".  

"gdfn.py" is an implementation of the Morphological Augmentation in Python that can be imported for practical model training in Pytorch.  

"training_gdfn.py" is an example of the model training with Morphological Augmentation.  

Pytorch 2.5+ and cuda 12.4+ are recommended.

Training and Test Instructions:  
```python
python training_gdfn.py
