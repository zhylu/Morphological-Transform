These are the source codes for "Morphological Augmentation of Image Data using Three-Dimensional Discrete Fuzzy Numbers: A Theoretical Foundation".
All the involved datasets are public and can be obtained according to the reffered papers. In the practice, the datasets are pre-processed as MAT files for accelerating training. A sample of the pre-processed dataset files is provided in dataset.txt.
gdfn-illustration.mlx is used to morphologically transform single image in Matlab.
gdfn.py is the method of morphological transform used in model training.
